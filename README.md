# ELK
Deployed ELK Stack during boot camp 
Created new VNet within AZURE
Created new VM within the new VNet 
Allowed SSH access via same public key as previous VM's 
Built .yml playbook to download docker, container, and auto-start container on boot 
Connected to my Kibana dashboard using my new VM's public IP through port 5061 that I opened up in my security group inbound rules
